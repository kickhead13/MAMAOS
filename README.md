# MAMA OS
by Ana Alexandru and Duna Alexandru<br>
<br>
This is a silly little side-project that I share with a dear friend of mine.<br>
This is not too serious of a project, and it's meant to be seen as a collection of modules that allow you to do a bunvh of things from the terminal<br>
# Run
To run MAMA OS you simply compile main.c and run the executable.<br>
You will, then, be greeted by the "OS" genie - m@rius - who will help you set up the terminal the way you want.<br>
After setting things up you will get access to your (user) and (admin) privileges.
# Some features
An in-terminal chess app:<br>

Basic disk management capabilities:<br>

# Future Updates & Ideas
## Better text editor
We want to add an actual text editor. Most likely in the style of Vim or Nvim, to allow the user to not only overwrite their files but also just edit them.<br>
## More games
More games such as chess, and maybe some more complex games such as some very old 20th century video game ports.<br>
## An online chat/forum for users
This is a more far-fetched goal, but it would something cool to implement: a chat for MAMA OS users to use from within MAMA OS.
